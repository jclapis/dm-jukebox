The following libraries were compiled from source during development:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

libopus was compiled from the 1.1.3 tag.
	I didn't modify it at all, it's vanilla v1.1.3. It's compiled directly from the VS 2015 solution provided in the repository.

libsoundio was compiled from the master branch, commit afe6024 as of 10/31/2016. It doesn't have a strict version number, but it came after 1.1.0.
	This library did have one small modification - in wasapi.c, line 1270, I changed the buffer reference time from 4.0 seconds to 0.05 seconds.
	The rationale was that WASAPI requires you to fill the buffer you request from it, or it breaks. If I left it at 4.0 seconds, then there would
	basically be a 4 second delay between any changes you make (volume tweaks, playing new tracks) and what you hear. Truncating that to 0.05 seconds
	makes the delay imperceptible. I used CMake to create a VS 2015 solution and compiled it from there.

ffmpeg was compiled from the release/3.2 branch, commit 7568b0f as of 11/6/2016. It's just v3.2 with a few fixes. It was compiled as a shared LGPL library.
	I didn't modify it at all. I compiled it on Windows using MSVC 2015.3 and MinGW, using the following config:
	> ./configure --enable-asm --enable-yasm --arch=x86_64 --enable-shared --toolchain=msvc
